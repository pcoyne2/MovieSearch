Project 2 for Udacity using moviedb API


This project used features such as Recyclerview, pagination, SQLite database, Content Providers, and AsyncTask to retrieve API calls and parsing JSON information.  Due to the requirement of using AsyncTask otherwise would have used Retrofit for ease of use.
